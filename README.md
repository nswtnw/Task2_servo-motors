## Step to Step the Circuit:
1. Arduino Setup:
   Place the Ardunio Uno on and ensure it is properly powered via USB or an external power source>
2. Breadboard:
   Place the breadboard beside the Arduino Uno to facilitate easy connections between the two.
3. Power and Ground Connections:
   * Connect the 5V pin on the ardunio to the positive power rail on the breadboard using a red wire.
   * Connect the GND pin on the arduino to the ground rail on the breadboard using a black wire.
